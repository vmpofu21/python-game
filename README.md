# python-game - MY FIRST EVER PYTHON PROGRAM 
FALL 2021 WITH PROFESSOR JOHN BARR

I have created a code-breaking game where the human is playing
against the computer.
• The code maker is the computer and the code breaker is the human
player with 5 chances to correctly guess the random four-digit code
generated by the computer or lose.
• The computer generates a four-digit code and the human player
attempts to correctly guess the digits by entering numbers of length
4.
• User cannot enter the number 0 amongst the numbers in their four-
digit code.
• If any digits from the user’s guessed code are correct the program
will hint the user.
• For additional features on my project, I will enhance the length of the
code and accommodate letters, making use of the ASCII chart. Be
able to guess someone’s password given a few pieces of
information.
